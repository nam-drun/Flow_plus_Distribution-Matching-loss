# What to get out from IMDE paper
We want to quantify the relationship between $`v_P(t, X_t^P)`$ and $`v_B(t, X_t)`$. So that we can verify on whether distribution matching loss makes learned velocity field getting closer to $`v_P(t, X_t^P)`$. Here, the left panel also displays our challenge: We don't really know Perturbed Continuous trajectory $`X_t^P`$ really is, so we can't derive $`v_P(t, X_t^P)`$ like how Flow Matching typically does it. Fortunately, theorem 3.2 in IMDE paper can help us quantify $`v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_B(t, X_t)`$.


# Bounding theorem 3.2 from IMDE paper
Now, the first expression in theorem 3.2 is:
```math
\Phi_{h,f}(x) = \phi_{h,f}(x) + h^{p+1} \delta_f(x) + \mathcal{O}(h^{p+2})
```

Which is backed by Figure 2 in the paper. This expression implicates that $`v_P(t, X_t^P)`$ is affected by our intent to leverage discretisation error via $-\delta f$. Therefore, the power series expansion of $`v_P(t, X_t^P)`$ now becomes:
```math
f_h - f = -h^p \delta f  + \mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})
```

Rewrite the LHS in "left panel"'s notation and write $`\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})` in full form:
```math
\begin{align*}
& v_P(t,x) - v_B(t,x) = -h^p \delta_{v_B}(t,x) + h^{p+1} f_{p+1} + h^{p+2} f_{p+2} + \cdots \\
& v_P(t,x) - v_B(t,x) = -h^p \delta_{v_B}(t,x) + h^{p+1}r_h(t,x) \\
\end{align*}
```

where $`r_h(t,x) = f_{p+1} + h f_{p+2} + h^2 f_{p+3} + \cdots`$. Although this is not yet $`v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_B(t, X_t)`$, but it nonetheless enables us to delegate the unknown to a simpler expression
```math
\begin{align*}
& v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_B(t, X_t) = v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_P(t, X_t) + v_P(t, X_t) - v_B(t, X_t) \\
& v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_B(t, X_t) = v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_P(t, X_t) -h^p \delta_{v_B}(t,x) + h^{p+1}r_h(t,x)
\end{align*}
```

Here, we invoke the Lipschitz regularity assumption on $v_B(t, X_t)$: $`\left\| v_B(t, X_t^P) - v_B(t, X_t) \right\| \le L(t) \left\| X_t^P - X_t \right\|`$. Note, if you feel confused about this statement, just read it as $`\left\| v_B(t, x + c) - v_B(t, x) \right\| \le L(t) \left\| (x + c) - x \right\|`$ with $`x \in X_t`$ and $`(x + c) \in X_t^P`$; then when I add $`c \to 0`$, this statement now reads like 1st principle of differentiation on $`v_B(t, x)`$. In other words, as $`c \to 0`$, $`L(t)`$ quite literally becomes the slope of $`v_B(t, x)`$. Anyway, this assumption generally holds true in Flow Matching, as shown by section 3.2 in [Error Bounds for Flow Matching Methods paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uqQPyWFDhY). 

Now we introduce another Lipschitz regularity assumption on $v_P(t,x)$: $`\left\| v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_P(t, X_t) \right\| \le L(t)_P \left\| X_t^P - X_t \right\|`$. Because this assumption comes out of nowhere so let's try to justify it: The core tenet of Flow Matching is that the ODE continuous trajectory $`X_t`$ needs to transport $X_0 \to X_1$. Whereas the core tenet of IMDE paper is that each continuous trajectory $`X_t`$ is explicitly linked to a corresponding perturbed continuous trajectory $`X_t^P`$. From initial experiments with post-trained Flow model, we observe that when the number of sampling steps during pretraining and post-training is $`[1, 4]`$, we observe that the post-trained models consistently have less discretisation compared to pretrained models. This is especially true for Euler solver. Thus, in term of Frechet distance and Wasserstein-2 distance, post-trained $P_1$ is closer to data distribution than pretrained $`P_1`$. At the very least, that seems to suggest that for every Base Continuous, there exists a set of corresponding Perturbed Continuous trajectories somewhere in $`\mathbb{R}^d`$ such that its Perturbed Euler's endpoint is closer to ideal $X_1$ than Base Euler's endpoint. 

With this Lipschitz regularity assumption on $v_P(t,x)$, we can bound $`v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_B(t, X_t)`$ as follows:
```math
\left\| v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_B(t, X_t) \right\| \le L(t)_P \left\| X_t^P - X_t \right\| + \left\| h^p \delta_{v_B}(t,x) + h^{p+1}r_h(t,x) \right\|
```

Now, we just need to figure out $`\left\| X_t^P - X_t \right\|`$ with Gronwall's inequality. Vanilla Gronwall's inequality has this basic structure:
```math
\begin{align*}
& \text{Given } \dot{f}(t) \le C(t)f(t) \Leftrightarrow f(t) \le f(0) + \int_0^t C(s)f(s) ds, \\
& \text{thus } f(t) \le f(0)\exp \left(\int_0^t C(s)ds \right) \\
\end{align*}
```
where $`C(s)`$ and $`f(t)`$ are some real-valued functions. But to deal with $`\left\| h^p \delta_{v_B}(t,x) + h^{p+1}r_h(t,x) \right\|`$, we'll use the extended version of Gronwall's inequality:
```math
\begin{align*}
& \text{Given } \dot{f}(t) \le C(t)f(t) + a(t) \Leftrightarrow f(t) \le f(0) + \int_0^t C(s)f(s) ds + \int_0^t a(s) ds, \\
& \text{thus } f(t) \le f(0) \exp \left(\int_0^t C(s)ds \right) + \int_0^t \exp \left(\int_0^t C(s)ds \right) a(s) ds \\
\end{align*}
```

Denote $`f(t) := \left\| X_t^P - X_t \right\|`$, thus $`\dot{f}(t) = \left\| v_P(t, X_t^P) - v_B(t, X_t) \right\|` and $`C(t) := L_p(t)`$. For $`f(0)`, we'll set it `f(0) := 0`$ since Perturbed Continuous and Base Continuous starts from the same $`X_0`$. This means that the remaining term to be denoted is $`a(t) := \left\| h^p \delta_{v_B}(t,x) + h^{p+1}r_h(t,x) \right\|`$. And with that, we now have access to the prerequisite condition of extended Gronwall's inequality. Applying extended Gronwall's inequality, we get:
```math
\begin{align*}
& \left\| X_t^P - X_t \right\| \le h^p \int_0^t \exp \left(\int_s^t L_P(r) dr \right) g(s)ds
\end{align*}
```
